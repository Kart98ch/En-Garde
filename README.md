A P2P multiplayer melee combat game where players can engage in intense, stressful duels where one miss swing can determine life or death!

The game features directional swinging and corresponding directional blocks, where both players must observe each other and predict/react to each other.

This is a game I made on my on Unreal Engine 5 and is my first attempt at making a multiplayer game. 

This is a project where I wanted to take elements of melee combat that I like in other games: Mount & Blade, JKA Movie Battles II - in particular. Though I did take inspiration from these games I wanted to experiment with alternate control schemes and not simply remakes of the schema found in its inspirations.

The animations and the arena map were bought on the UE Marketplace.
